        .about-text
          p I was born in 1987 in Siófok, Hungary.
          p I studied graphic art and painting for seven years at various institutions, but the experience was so disheartening that I stopped painting for ten years.
          p In 2023, I moved to the Netherlands and began painting again.
          p Unlike my earlier work, I now focus exclusively on classical-style paintings on canvas. My favorite subjects are old brick buildings or vibrant landscapes.
          p I can create a painting from a photo of a building if you like, but I don't do portraits.
